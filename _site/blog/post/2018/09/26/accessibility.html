    <h2>What is Web Accessibility</h2>
    <p>
      Web accessibility is the practice of building (design and developing) websites and other digital products so that users of
      all abilities can access them. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provides a standard on how to do this and
      provides a success criteria of A, AA, and AAA. A success criteria is essentially a measure for the level of complaiance
      a website or application holds itself to.
    </p>
    <br>
      <h3>Inaccessible websites create barriers for users who are/have:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
        Blind or low vision
        </li>
        <li>
        Deaf or Hearing Impaired
        </li>
        <li>
        Cognitative disabilities
        </uli>
        <li>
        Limited motor skills
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
    <h3>Why Should We Care?</h3>
    <p>
      Often times companies brush of accessibility as unnecessary. Remarks such as "Those arent our users" and "We've always
      done it this way" are common rationals for keeping up with the status quo. In a perfect world we should all genuinely
      care about all users, including those with disabilities. Fortunately, there are several benefits to accessibility
      besides that fuzzy feeling you get when you're a decent human being.
    </p>
    <p>
      To put it simply: accessibilty means good business. For example, if a site uses proper things like image alt attributes,
      title and header tags and html semantic markup, it returns better SEO results. Another factor is that most people
      at some point in their lives experience become disabled, even temporarily. Often times, most people
      will have difficulty viewing screens after lasik eye surgery. Broswer features like high contrast mode allow users to
      view screens with less strain on their eyes. Lastly, designing for accessibility safeguards your client against legal
      ramifications for non-complaince. If your client works in areas of the government, healthcare or airlines they are
      are most likely legally bound to adhere to WCAG. Even if they are outside these industries, they are still vulnerable
      to lawsuits. <a href="https://www.boia.org/blog/2018s-flood-of-accessibility-lawsuits">Among others in 2018</a>, giants like
      Amazon and Nike have come under attack for non-compliance.

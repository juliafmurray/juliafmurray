    <h2>What is Web Accessibility</h2>
    <p>
      Web accessibility is the practice of building (design and developing) websites and other digital products so that users of
      all abilities can access them. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provides a standard on how to do this and
      provides a success criteria of A, AA, and AAA. A success criteria is essentially a measure for the level of complaiance
      a website or application holds itself to.
    </p>
    <br>
      <h3>Inaccessible websites create barriers for users who are/have:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
        Blind or low vision
        </li>
        <li>
        Deaf or Hearing Impaired
        </li>
        <li>
        Cognitative disabilities
        </uli>
        <li>
        Limited motor skills
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
    <h3>Why Should We Care?</h3>
    <p>
      Often times companies brush of accessibility as unnecessary. Remarks such as "Those arent our users" and "We've always
      done it this way" are common rationals for keeping up with the status quo. In a perfect world we should all genuinely
      care about all users, including those with disabilities. Fortunately, there are several benefits to accessibility
      besides that fuzzy feeling you get when you're a decent human being.
    </p>
    <p>
      To put it simply: accessibilty means good business. For example, if a site uses proper things like image alt attributes,
      title and header tags and html semantic markup, it returns better SEO results. Another factor is that most people
      at some point in their lives experience become disabled, even temporarily. Often times, most people
      will have difficulty viewing screens after lasik eye surgery. Broswer features like high contrast mode allow users to
      view screens with less strain on their eyes. Lastly, designing for accessibility safeguards your client against legal
      ramifications for non-complaince. If your client works in areas of the government, healthcare or airlines they are
      are most likely legally bound to adhere to WCAG. Even if they are outside these industries, they are still vulnerable
      to lawsuits. <a href="https://www.boia.org/blog/2018s-flood-of-accessibility-lawsuits">Among others in 2018</a>, giants like
      Amazon and Nike have come under attack for non-compliance.

    <h3>Start by Starting</h3>
    <p>
      Creating and implementing accessible digital products has 3 contributing parties: design (UX/visual), development and
      business. If you and/or your company is new to web accessibility, it can seem pretty intimidating to start. As a designer,
      your advantage is that you have influence from the very begining on implementing accessibity into your digital product.
      Up next well go through some very easy steps in order to start designing for accessibility and its benefits.
    </p>

    <h2>Make sure your colors meet contrast ratios</h2>
      <p> One of the first things a designer can to to ensure for accessibility is to make sure their designs meet the
          correct color contrast ratio. The most recent guidelines just came out, 2.1 and with that comes some additional
          requirements from the previous 2.0.
      </p>
      <h3>2.0: Text and Background Color:</h3>
      <p>
        Previously, the only thing color contrast applied to was text and background color. Level AA requires a contrast
        ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. Level AAA requires a contrast ratio of at least
        7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text.
      </p>
      <h3>2.1: Images and UI Elements:</h3>
      <p>
        In the case that a graphic is essential for understanding content or functionality on website, the contrast ratio
        of at least 4.5:1 against the surrounding colors. This isnt a hard and fast rule though, as there are some exceptions.
        Any graphic that has a minimum height and width of 3px as well as logo types or anything that is non-essential is excluded.
      </p>
      <p>UI elements are also required to meet contrast standards in 2.1. Any UI elemenet deemed essential
        to understand content functionality must meet a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 against the surrounding colors. Exceptions for This
        include elements with a minimum of 3px must meet a contrast ratio of 3:1. Disbaled or inactive UI elements are also
        exempt from this guideline.
      </p>
      <p> Caluculating these contrast ratios seems like a really tedious task, but it's not!

  <p>
    I’m only about 2 weeks into my apprenticeship as well as my introduction to Git and Github. So far I'd like to say one thing:
    Git makes me feel really dumb. Going through some of these concepts makes me feel like I am literally re-wiring my
    brain, but some of the wires aren't connecting. One of my first steps of being not dumb at Git has been to read
    <cite>Git for Humans</cite> by David Demaree. Overall it was a really helpful book, but mostly due to the subject matter,
    it wasn't exactly a page turner. Next I'll go through the general concepts from the book, explain them with brief command
    examples.

<h3>Version Control</h3>
  <p>
    Overall, I understand the need for version control software, especially for larger companies with multiple people working
    on different design iterations of the same site or application. As a designer one of my pet peeves is to have a work folder
    with 20 different files with no specificity or naming convention, especially when you find out the file names have nothing
    to do with the actual content in the file.
  </p>
  <br>
<h3>The Command Line</h3>
  <p>
    The command line makes me feel really dumb. As a designer, I think in terms of visually moving a thing to a things and
    seeing that thing happen makes me feel like there is some order to this crazy world. The command line turns my brain inside
    out and upside down and leaves me unsure about what reality really is. That being said, I feel like I am 20 times more
    comfortable with the command line than I did my first day.
  </p>
  <p>
    The command line is essentially a non-graphical way to navigate through directories both locally on your computer and (I think)
    somehow, remotely find other directories other places, like Github. You as a user can type in commands into an program
    called Terminal, those commands will run, and sometimes, you will get a confirmation about the result of those commands.
    If you ever saw the 1995 movie Hackers, you may have a better understanding of what I'm talking about. If only we were
    cool enough to have nicknames like "Zero Cool" or "Crash Override".

<h3>Start a New Project or Clone an Existing Project</h3>
  <p>
    After initializing Github, you'll either need to create a new project or start on an exisitng project. In
    order to start a new project you first need to make a directory for it by sending the command:<br>
    <code>$: mkdir new-project</code>.<br>
    This will make a new directory with a folder called "new project". Next we need to change to that directory
    in order to start working in it:<br>
    <code>$: cd new:project</code><br>
    The last step in this step is to initiaize the repository<br>
    <code>$: git init</code><br>
  </p>
  <p>
    More often than not, you'll be working on exisiting software that you need to make changes to. This means that
    you'll need to clone off of an existing repo. Cloning means that what gets saved in your local directory is an
    exact replica of the files on the server. You'll start out with the <code>git clone</code> command which a real
    powerhouse command that does multiple things at once. It will create the new directory, initializes the new
    repository, adds an <code>origin</code> remote while pulling changes from the it at the same time.
  </p>
  <br>
<h3>Commiting to a Branch</h3>
  <p>
    After you have your project set up in your directory, and you've made the changes in your code, you need to commit.
    A commit is essentially a stored version of the project with your changes in it, but separate because it hasnt been
    merged with what is live. This book refers to it as an object, which is a strange and overly vague term that that isn't
    really helpful. So I'll just call it an unmerged version. I'm not quite sure what the process is for 8th Light, but
    I assume as a design crafter I would commit my changes, have a code review and then they would be merged with the master
    branch.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before you commit, you need to decide on a branch to commit it to. What is a branch exactly? To out it simple a branch
    is merely a label, saying this code is different from what is live and we categorize it by "x" branch. When starting a
    new project, Git creates a default branch and calls it master. In many cases master is what you will see live on the
    site, but not always, it depends on the company and their front end development process.
  <p>
  <p>
    In many cases you'll want to create a new branch. Git has separate commands for creating a new branch and checking
    it our (which moves you to it) but thats annoying. Great thing is theres a combination command that does both things
    at once:<br>
    <code> git checkout -b new-project</code>. Once this is done you can confirm that you created and in the
    branch that you want by passing:<br>
    <code>$: git branch</code>
    If everything is working correctly, you should recieve a message with a <code>*</code> and the branch name you just made.
  </p>
<br>
<h3>Merging</h3>
  <p>
    So far you've created or modified a directory, made some changes to it and committed those changes to a branch within
    the repository. After reviewing your code to make sure everything is good, the next step would be to merge it with
    the masterbranch, or whichever branch you've decided the live site is pulling from. The first thing you do would be
    to checkout the master branch with <code>$: git checkout master</code>. You'll then want to pull changes from the previous
    branch you were working on and merge them with master, so you'll pass along <code>$: git merge new-project</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are two kinds of merges, fast forward and merge commits. Fast forwards are great, but only really work when one of the
    two branches you're merging has a new commit (this is usually the non-master one). Here, git moves the head of the master
    commit to the "other" one you just committed to. If you've got changes both in your master and your other branch, the
    best thing to do is a merge commit. With this, Git needs to create a combined snapshot of the changes in both branches
    and figure out what the new merge is going to look like. In order to do this it will find the first common ancestor
    in order to figure out what has changed and what hasn't. As long as both branches don't have changes in the same line,
    Git should be able to merge both branches successfully.
  </p>

<h3>Remotes</h3>
  <p>
    So far, many of the topics I've discussed work perfectly for someone working on a project locally on their compputer.
    One of the most powerful things about Git is that is allows multiple people from multiple locations in the world
    to collaborate on a project. This is where remotes come in. A remote repository is how a single person can access
    a directory that lives somewhere besides that persons local computer. Most of the itme, this is where Github comes
    in. While Git is the version control system, Github is a hosting service for Git repositories. Going back to one of
    the earier terms in this post, a remote is where you would clone your repository onto your local computer and make
    changes that would then be commited and merged into a branch.
  </p>
  <p>
    Something you may have to do with remotes is make a remote an origin for our project. To do this, you pass along
    <code>
      (master) $: git remote add origin https://new-project.com
    </code> <br>
    <code>git remote</code> is a command with several sub-commands. The sub-commands for <code>git remote</code>
    are <code>add</code> and <code>rm</code> among others.
  </p>
  <p>
    Related to remotes is <code>git fetch</code> whic allows you to work offline. It'll pull down a copy of every branch
    of a remote and it will allow you to commit changes and merge to a branch without having to be online.
  </p>
<br>
<h3>History</h3>
  <p>
    For every commit that's made theres a history of it, which is a really powerful feature. You can even view the commit
    history even if you don't use Github as a hosting service. The first command you'll pass is <code>git log</code>
    and in response you'll get a list of every commit for a project and will give you the commit id, author, date, and
    what the change was.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most of the time seeing every commit that ever happened isn't the most useful thing, but Git
    has a solution for that. You can add on a format string, which is just an addition to the <code>git log</code>
    command. The format string <code>--pretty=oneline</code> will only show the commit id and commit message in a single line.
    Another helpful command is that you can choose to view your commit history in a range format. For this your
    reference points are two commit references to see what happened between then in a start and end format:<br>
    <code>$: git log --oneline master..new-homepage</code><br>
    The <code>..</code>separates the start and end branch and returns with the history wihtin those ranges for you.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also filter your commit history by recency, date range, or by author. You can do this by passing along:<br>
    <code>$: git log --author=Murray --grep=cats --oneline Gemfile</code><br>
    This is telling Git that you want to see a commit history for something authored by me, containing the words cats
    and changed the file called Gemfile.

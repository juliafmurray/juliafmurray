        The main goal when designing for the web, is to keep the user engaged with the content. If not designed well, content
        can be complicated and important peices of information can be skipped over by the user. This is one of the biggest
        challanges of creating a layout as a designer. You want it to simple and easy to consume the content, but break it up
        in a way to keep the user interested and engaged. One of the first steps to designing a layout is to establish a grid
        that elements will fall into within the layout. Below are some basic principles and anatomy of a grid.
      </p>

      <h3 class="c-blog-post__heading">Grid Design Principles</h3>
        <ul class="c-blog-post__ul">
          <li class="c-blog-post__li">
            <b>Clarity/Order</b> makes it easier for users to find and navigate through content.
          </li>
          <li class="c-blog-post__li">
            <b>Efficiency</b> allows designers change their design without having to start all over. When designing a grid structure, various
            elements and layouts are addressed to avoid re-work.
            while building the grid structure.
          </li>
          <li class="c-blog-post__li">
            <b>Economy</b> makes it easier for multiple designers to work on the same design. An established grid structure is like a building
            plan that lets everyone know where to go depending on the situation.
          </li>
          <li class="c-blog-post__li">
            <b>Consistency/Harmony</b> allows for different layouts across a site to feel as though they fit within a single design
            sytem.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="c-blog-post__heading">Grid Anatomy</h3>
          <ul class="c-blog-post__ul">
            <li class="c-blog-post__li">
              A <b>grid container</b> contains all elements of a grid.
            </li>
            <li class="c-blog-post__li">
              <b>Grid Lines</b> are referred to by grid line numbers. They are used when specifing where to place elements within a grid.
              For example, an element can placed at a particular grid line, or between two grid lines.
            </li>
            <li class="c-blog-post__li">
             A <b>grid column</b> is the space between two adjacent vertical grid lines. The size of a grid column is determined by
             the grid-template-columns property.
            </li>
            <li class="c-blog-post__li">
              <b>Grid rows</b> are the space between two adjacent horizontal grid lines. It's size is determined by the
              grid-template-rows property. Both grid columns and rows can be referred to as a grid track.
            </li>
            <li class="c-blog-post__li">
              <b>Grid cells</b> exist between grid columns and rows. Cells are defined as any space inside of four grid
              lines. A single grid cell or collection of multiple cells as a grid area.
            </li>
          </ul>
      </p>

      <h3 class="c-blog-post__heading">CSS Grids, Flexbox & Media Queries</h3>
        <p class="c-blog-post__paragraph">
          There are two approaches you can take when implementing your design into code, flexbox and css grids. Flexbox is great
          if you don't need to change your design much for different screen sizes. This works great if you're designing things
          that are text heavy and don't have a bunch of different components. So if your design is limited to columns and rows
          with basic line wrapping, Flexbox is the way to go. You can use flexbox with media queries to make your flexbox elements
          responsive.
        </p>
        <p class="c-blog-post__paragraph">
          Because of item simplicity, flexbox is considered one-dimensional while css grids are two-dimensional.
          CSS works great for design that require a variety of columns per row. It's also the way to go for any layout that
          needs to be responsive.
        </p>
        <h4 class="c-blog-post__heading">Flexbox</h4>

          <p class="c-blog-post__paragraph">
            The first thing to do here is to nest all the elements within the <code class="c-blog-post__markup">
            div class="flex-container"</code>. Once you've do that in your css you can define some flexbox properties:
          </p>
            <code class="c-blog-post__markup">
            display: flex;<br>
            flex-wrap: wrap;<br>
            justify-content: center;<br>
            </code><br>
            <p class="c-blog-post__paragraph">
              Although flexbox is normally used for designs that don't need to change much for different device widths,
              I just wanted to see how media queries worked with it, and it turned out pretty good I think.
            </p>
            <code class="c-blog-post__markup">
              @media screen and (min-width: $width-small) {<br>
                background-color: $color-black;<br>
                margin: 1.14% 0;<br>
                width: 22%; }<br>
                <br>
              @media screen and (min-width: $width-large) {<br>
                background-color: $color-purple;<br>
                margin: .44% 0;<br>
                width: 12%; }<br>
            </code><br>

            <div class="flexwrapper">
                <div class="flexwrapper__one">üßõ‚Äç</div>
                <div class="flexwrapper__two">üéÉ</div>
                <div class="flexwrapper__three">ü¶á</div>
                <div class="flexwrapper__four">üßô</div>
                <div class="flexwrapper__five">üîÆ</div>
                <div class="flexwrapper__six">üßü‚Äç</div>
            </div>

      <h4 class="c-blog-post__heading">CSS Grids</h4>
        <p class="c-blog-post__paragraph">
          I found CSS grids to work much better working within BEM. After nesting elements within
          <code class="c-blog-post__markup">div class="wrapper"</code> you can define your columns
          in percentages within the stylesheet.<br>
        </p>
        <code class="c-blog-post__markup">
          .wrapper {<br>
          display: grid;<br>
          grid-template-columns: 25% 25% 25% 25%; }<br>
        </code>

        <p class="c-blog-post__paragraph">
          Although I only defined four columns for this excercise, many websites use a base of 12 since
          it can easily be divded by both 3 and 4, and provides more layout flexibility. If I left this as is,
          each emoji by default on here would take up a single cell, from one gridline to the next. CSS grids
          allow us to make up bigger columns out of our 12 columns, so I thought I'd try it out. For example,
          I used the <code class="c-blog-post__markup">grid-column-start</code> and
          <code class="c-blog-post__markup">grid-column-end</code> to define where my emojiis would start and end.
        </p>

          <code class="c-blog-post__markup">
            .wrapper__one {<br>
              background-color: $color-black;<br>
              <br>
              @media screen and (min-width: $width-small) {<br>
                grid-column-end: 5;<br>
                grid-column-start: 1; }<br>
                <br>
              @media screen and (min-width: $width-medium) {<br>
                grid-column-end: 3;<br>
                grid-column-start: 1; }<br>
                <br>
              @media screen and (min-width: $width-large) {<br>
                grid-column-end: 2;<br>
                grid-column-start: 1; }<br>
                }
          </code>

            <div class="wrapper">
              <div class="wrapper__one">üßõ‚Äç</div>
              <div class="wrapper__two">üéÉ</div>
              <div class="wrapper__three">ü¶á</div>
              <div class="wrapper__four">üßô</div>
              <div class="wrapper__five">üîÆ</div>
              <div class="wrapper__six">üßü‚Äç</div>
            </div>

            I much prefer this method of creating reponsive layouts because I works within the current BEM methodology,
            and it allows for much more flexibility of grid layouts with your designs.

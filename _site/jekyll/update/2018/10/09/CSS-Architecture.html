        in depth since it is the 8th Light convention.

          SASS is a meta language on top of css that describes the stylesheet more structurally and cleanly with reusable code.
          Through a simplified syntax and various features for setting styles, style sheets are much more managable than
          regular CSS. It's a common practice to create SASS based design systems since its so easy to update style sheets since
          the styles are reused and not repeated. These are the various features within SASS:
        </p>
        <h5 class="c-blog-post__heading">Variables</h5>
        <p class="c-blog-post_paragraph">
          Variables are a way to create values and reuse them throughout your styles. You can
          define a set style starting with with something easy to remember. For example, in <code>tokens.scss</code>
          you can define a font size with a variable as <code>$font-size-small: 1em;</code>. Later in your
          <code>main.scss</code> you could define <code>p { $font-size-small; }</code>. If you decide to change that
          font size from <code>1em</code> to <code>1.125em</code> you only have to update one line of code in your
          <code>tokens.scss</code>. SASS will go in and update every instance of <code>$font-size-small</code> for you.
        </p>

        <h5 class="c-blog-post__heading">Mixins</h5>
        <p class="c-blog-post_paragraph">
          Mixins are similar to variables, but they allow you to establish styles in blocks. You can define mixin styles inside
          a separates mixin.scss file with <code>@mixin title-style</code>. Once you're in your style sheet you can declare it
          you by nesting it in any class.
        </p>

      <h3 class="c-blog-post__heading">ITCSS</h3>
        <p class="c-blog-post__paragraph">
          ITCSS stands for Inverted Triangle CSS. Its a CSS structure that allows you to structure files in a way that will
          you work more efficiently with global namespace, cascade and selectors specificity. It's divided into layers that
          start with the most broad and get more specific as you progress.
        </p>
          <ul class-"c-blog-post__list">
            <li class-"c-blog-post__listitem">
              Settings: Used with preprocessors and contain font, colors definitions, etc.
            </li>
            <li class-"c-blog-post__listitem">
              Tools: Globally used mixins and functions. It’s important not to output any CSS
              in the first 2 layers.
            </li>
            <li class-"c-blog-post__listitem">
              Generic: reset and/or normalize styles, box-sizing definition, etc. This is the first layer which generates
              actual CSS.
            </li>
            <li class-"c-blog-post__listitem">
              Elements: styling for HTML elements like <code>h1</code>, <code>p</code> etc. These come with default styling
              from the browser so we can redefine them here.
            </li>
            <li class-"c-blog-post__listitem">
              Objects: class-based selectors which define undecorated design patterns, for example media object known
              from OOCSS.
            </li>
            <li class-"c-blog-post__listitem">
              Components: This is where the majority of CSS and UI components are stored. It can consist of components
              and objects togther.
            </li>
            <li class-"c-blog-post__listitem">
              Utilities: utilities and helper classes with ability to override anything which goes before in the triangle,
              eg. hide helper class
            </li>
          </ul>

      <h3 class="c-blog-post__heading">OOCSS</h3>
        <p class="c-blog-post__paragraph">
          The purpose of OOCSS is to encourage code reuse and, ultimately, faster and more efficient stylesheets that are
          easier to add to and maintain. OOCSS is based on two principles:
        </p>
          <h5 class="c-blog-post__heading">Principle One: Separation of structure from the skin</h5>
            <p class ="c-blog-post__paragraph">
              Web page elements have several visual features or skins that are repeated in different contexts. After being
              converted into class based modules, skins can be applied to any element and have the same basic result.
              By applying a “skin” class to all the elements, you can style multiple elements while using very little code.
            </p>
          <h5 class ="c-blog-post__subtitle">Principle Two: Separation of containers and content</h5>
          <p class ="c-blog-post__paragraph">
            In order to avoid unnecessary repeating styles, OOCSS takes what is common among different elements and separates
            the commonalities into modules, or objects. The goal here is to ensure that styles are not dependent on any
            containing element. This means they can then be reused anywhere in the document, regardless of structural context.
          </p>

      <h3 class="c-blog-post__heading">SMACSS</h3>
      <p class="c-blog-post__paragraph">
        SMACSS stands for Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS. It is more style guide than it is a rigid framework.
        The main goal is to identify design patterns and to determine better practices for using them. Again like the other
        frameworks we've gone through, the point here is to re-use code and not repeat it. The are five main categories
        are below:
      </p>
        <ul class="c-blog-post__list">
            <li class="c-blog-post__listitem">
              Base consists of single element selectors such as heading sizes, default link styles,
              default font styles, and body backgrounds. It will specify styles for whatever elements are
              indicated on a page.
            </li>
            <li class="c-blog-post__listitem">
              Layouts will divide the page into sections. Examples are navigation, header, footer, sidebar, etc.
              Layouts hold one or more modules together.
            </li>
            <li class="c-blog-post__listitem">
              Modules are reusable, segmented parts of a design. This would be typography, buttons, components, etc.
            </li>
            <li class="c-blog-post__listitem">
                States define how a module or layout behaves. Different states could be what something looks like when
                it is responsive, or how it will change from the homepage to an interior page.
              </li>
            <li class="c-blog-post__listitem">Themes are very like like states, although they are not always used.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3 class="c-blog-post__heading">BEM</h3>
      <p class="c-blog-post__paragraph">
        BEM is a component-based approach to web development and stands for block element modifier . The idea behind it is to
        divide the user interface of a design into independent blocks. This makes development easy and fast and works well even
        with a complicated UI. The goal here with other CSS architecture methods is to reuse code, not repeat it.
      </p>

      <h5 class="c-blog-post__heading">Block</h5>
      <p class="c-blog-post__paragraph">
        A block is defined as functionally independent page component that can be reused. Blocks are essentially any HTML element
        that can take a class attribute. A block is a defining term, and not a descriptive one.<br>
        Example: <code>div class=”nav”</code>
      </p>

      <h5 class="c-blog-post__heading">Element</h5>
      <p class="c-blog-post__paragraph">
        An element is nested within a block and can't be used without it. An element is a defining term, not a descriptive one.
        In HTML, the class is structured <code>block-name__element-name</code>. The element name is separated from the block
        name with a double underscore <code>__</code>. You can nest multiple elements as long as they are nested inside the block,
        not inside each other.<br>
        Example: <code>div class=”nav__navitem”</code>
      </p>

      <h5 class="c-blog-post__heading">Modifiers</h5>
      <p class="c-blog-post__paragraph">
        Modifiers describe a style of a block and/or element. They are declared in a class following the block and/or elements
        with a double dash <code>--</code>. Its important to name modifiers in a way to describe what they are doing, not what
        the actual style is. For example its better to name a modifier as <code>alert</code> and not <code>red</code>.<br>
        Example: <code>div class=”nav__navitem--alert”</code>
      </p>

      <h5 class="c-blog-post__heading">Nesting Rules</h5>
      <p class="c-blog-post__paragraph">
        BEM is great because of its flexibility with its nesting rules, while still maintaining some guardrails. Below are some
        general rules to keep in mind with nesting:<br>
      </p>

      <ul class="c-blog-post__list">
          <li class="c-blog-post__listitem">
            BEM is structered in order of reach from broad to specific. Modifiers are children of elements, and elements are
            children of blocks. Blocks are the highest and most broad level. You could never nest an element in a modifier.
          </li>
          <li class="c-blog-post__listitem">
            Blocks and modifiers are required, but elements are optional. If there is no element, the modifier would be the
            direct child of thier block.
          </li>
          <li class="c-blog-post__listitem">
            You can nest a block within a block
          </li>
          <li class="c-blog-post__listitem">
            You can nest multiple elements or modifiers in a block. If you have two elements, they would be nested within
            that block. Meaning, you cannot nest an element within another element. The same goes for a modifier. In addition,
            you can have an element with two modifiers as long as both modifiers are nested within the element and not within
            eachother.
          </li>
      </ul>

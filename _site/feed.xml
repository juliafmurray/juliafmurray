  &lt;h2&gt;Git for Humans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;

&lt;section&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    I’m only about 2 weeks into my apprenticeship as well as my introduction to Git and Github. So far I'd like to say one thing:
    Git makes me feel really dumb. Going through some of these concepts makes me feel like I am literally re-wiring my
    brain, but some of the wires aren't connecting. One of my first steps of being not dumb at Git has been to read
    &lt;cite&gt;Git for Humans&lt;/cite&gt; by David Demaree. Overall it was a really helpful book, but mostly due to the subject matter,
    it wasn't exactly a page turner. Next I'll go through the general concepts from the book, explain them with brief command
    examples.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Version Control&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Overall, I understand the need for version control software, especially for larger companies with multiple people working
    on different design iterations of the same site or application. As a designer one of my pet peeves is to have a work folder
    with 20 different files with no specificity or naming convention, especially when you find out the file names have nothing
    to do with the actual content in the file.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Command Line&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    The command line makes me feel really dumb. As a designer, I think in terms of visually moving a thing to a things and
    seeing that thing happen makes me feel like there is some order to this crazy world. The command line turns my brain inside
    out and upside down and leaves me unsure about what reality really is. That being said, I feel like I am 20 times more
    comfortable with the command line than I did my first day.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    The command line is essentially a non-graphical way to navigate through directories both locally on your computer and (I think)
    somehow, remotely find other directories other places, like Github. You as a user can type in commands into an program
    called Terminal, those commands will run, and sometimes, you will get a confirmation about the result of those commands.
    If you ever saw the 1995 movie Hackers, you may have a better understanding of what I'm talking about. If only we were
    cool enough to have nicknames like &quot;Zero Cool&quot; or &quot;Crash Override&quot;.
    &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Start a New Project or Clone an Existing Project&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    After initializing Github, you'll either need to create a new project or start on an exisitng project. In
    order to start a new project you first need to make a directory for it by sending the command:&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$: mkdir new-project&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
    This will make a new directory with a folder called &quot;new project&quot;. Next we need to change to that directory
    in order to start working in it:&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$: cd new:project&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    The last step in this step is to initiaize the repository&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$: git init&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    More often than not, you'll be working on exisiting software that you need to make changes to. This means that
    you'll need to clone off of an existing repo. Cloning means that what gets saved in your local directory is an
    exact replica of the files on the server. You'll start out with the &lt;code&gt;git clone&lt;/code&gt; command which a real
    powerhouse command that does multiple things at once. It will create the new directory, initializes the new
    repository, adds an &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt; remote while pulling changes from the it at the same time.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Commiting to a Branch&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    After you have your project set up in your directory, and you've made the changes in your code, you need to commit.
    A commit is essentially a stored version of the project with your changes in it, but separate because it hasnt been
    merged with what is live. This book refers to it as an object, which is a strange and overly vague term that that isn't
    really helpful. So I'll just call it an unmerged version. I'm not quite sure what the process is for 8th Light, but
    I assume as a design crafter I would commit my changes, have a code review and then they would be merged with the master
    branch.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Before you commit, you need to decide on a branch to commit it to. What is a branch exactly? To out it simple a branch
    is merely a label, saying this code is different from what is live and we categorize it by &quot;x&quot; branch. When starting a
    new project, Git creates a default branch and calls it master. In many cases master is what you will see live on the
    site, but not always, it depends on the company and their front end development process.
  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    In many cases you'll want to create a new branch. Git has separate commands for creating a new branch and checking
    it our (which moves you to it) but thats annoying. Great thing is theres a combination command that does both things
    at once:&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;code&gt; git checkout -b new-project&lt;/code&gt;. Once this is done you can confirm that you created and in the
    branch that you want by passing:&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$: git branch&lt;/code&gt;
    If everything is working correctly, you should recieve a message with a &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; and the branch name you just made.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Merging&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    So far you've created or modified a directory, made some changes to it and committed those changes to a branch within
    the repository. After reviewing your code to make sure everything is good, the next step would be to merge it with
    the masterbranch, or whichever branch you've decided the live site is pulling from. The first thing you do would be
    to checkout the master branch with &lt;code&gt;$: git checkout master&lt;/code&gt;. You'll then want to pull changes from the previous
    branch you were working on and merge them with master, so you'll pass along &lt;code&gt;$: git merge new-project&lt;/code&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    There are two kinds of merges, fast forward and merge commits. Fast forwards are great, but only really work when one of the
    two branches you're merging has a new commit (this is usually the non-master one). Here, git moves the head of the master
    commit to the &quot;other&quot; one you just committed to. If you've got changes both in your master and your other branch, the
    best thing to do is a merge commit. With this, Git needs to create a combined snapshot of the changes in both branches
    and figure out what the new merge is going to look like. In order to do this it will find the first common ancestor
    in order to figure out what has changed and what hasn't. As long as both branches don't have changes in the same line,
    Git should be able to merge both branches successfully.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Remotes&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    So far, many of the topics I've discussed work perfectly for someone working on a project locally on their compputer.
    One of the most powerful things about Git is that is allows multiple people from multiple locations in the world
    to collaborate on a project. This is where remotes come in. A remote repository is how a single person can access
    a directory that lives somewhere besides that persons local computer. Most of the itme, this is where Github comes
    in. While Git is the version control system, Github is a hosting service for Git repositories. Going back to one of
    the earier terms in this post, a remote is where you would clone your repository onto your local computer and make
    changes that would then be commited and merged into a branch.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Something you may have to do with remotes is make a remote an origin for our project. To do this, you pass along
    &lt;code&gt;
      (master) $: git remote add origin https://new-project.com
    &lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git remote&lt;/code&gt; is a command with several sub-commands. The sub-commands for &lt;code&gt;git remote&lt;/code&gt;
    are &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rm&lt;/code&gt; among others.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Related to remotes is &lt;code&gt;git fetch&lt;/code&gt; whic allows you to work offline. It'll pull down a copy of every branch
    of a remote and it will allow you to commit changes and merge to a branch without having to be online.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;History&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    For every commit that's made theres a history of it, which is a really powerful feature. You can even view the commit
    history even if you don't use Github as a hosting service. The first command you'll pass is &lt;code&gt;git log&lt;/code&gt;
    and in response you'll get a list of every commit for a project and will give you the commit id, author, date, and
    what the change was.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Most of the time seeing every commit that ever happened isn't the most useful thing, but Git
    has a solution for that. You can add on a format string, which is just an addition to the &lt;code&gt;git log&lt;/code&gt;
    command. The format string &lt;code&gt;--pretty=oneline&lt;/code&gt; will only show the commit id and commit message in a single line.
    Another helpful command is that you can choose to view your commit history in a range format. For this your
    reference points are two commit references to see what happened between then in a start and end format:&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$: git log --oneline master..new-homepage&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    The &lt;code&gt;..&lt;/code&gt;separates the start and end branch and returns with the history wihtin those ranges for you.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    You can also filter your commit history by recency, date range, or by author. You can do this by passing along:&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$: git log --author=Murray --grep=cats --oneline Gemfile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    This is telling Git that you want to see a commit history for something authored by me, containing the words cats
    and changed the file called Gemfile.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

        <title>Web Accessibility</title>
        <description>&lt;header&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;What is Web Accessibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Web accessibility is the practice of building (design and developing) websites and other digital products so that users of
      all abilities can access them. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provides a standard on how to do this and
      provides a success criteria of A, AA, and AAA. A success criteria is essentially a measure for the level of complaiance
      a website or application holds itself to.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;Inaccessible websites create barriers for users who are/have:&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
        Blind or low vision
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
        Deaf or Hearing Impaired
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
        Cognitative disabilities
        &lt;/uli&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
        Limited motor skills
        &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Why Should We Care?&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Often times companies brush of accessibility as unnecessary. Remarks such as &quot;Those arent our users&quot; and &quot;We've always
      done it this way&quot; are common rationals for keeping up with the status quo. In a perfect world we should all genuinely
      care about all users, including those with disabilities. Fortunately, there are several benefits to accessibility
      besides that fuzzy feeling you get when you're a decent human being.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      To put it simply: accessibilty means good business. For example, if a site uses proper things like image alt attributes,
      title and header tags and html semantic markup, it returns better SEO results. Another factor is that most people
      at some point in their lives experience become disabled, even temporarily. Often times, most people
      will have difficulty viewing screens after lasik eye surgery. Broswer features like high contrast mode allow users to
      view screens with less strain on their eyes. Lastly, designing for accessibility safeguards your client against legal
      ramifications for non-complaince. If your client works in areas of the government, healthcare or airlines they are
      are most likely legally bound to adhere to WCAG. Even if they are outside these industries, they are still vulnerable
      to lawsuits. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boia.org/blog/2018s-flood-of-accessibility-lawsuits&quot;&gt;Among others in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, giants like
      Amazon and Nike have come under attack for non-compliance.
      &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Start by Starting&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Creating and implementing accessible digital products has 3 contributing parties: design (UX/visual), development and
      business. If you and/or your company is new to web accessibility, it can seem pretty intimidating to start. As a designer,
      your advantage is that you have influence from the very begining on implementing accessibity into your digital product.
      Up next well go through some very easy steps in order to start designing for accessibility and its benefits.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;1). Make sure your colors meet contrast ratios&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; One of the first things a designer can to to ensure for accessibility is to make sure their designs meet the
          correct color contrast ratio. The most recent guidelines just came out, 2.1 and with that comes some additional
          requirements from the previous 2.0.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;h4&gt;2.0: Text and Background Color:&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        Previously, the only thing color contrast applied to was text and background color. Level AA requires a contrast
        ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. Level AAA requires a contrast ratio of at least
        7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;h4&gt;2.1: Images and UI Elements:&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        In the case that a graphic is essential for understanding content or functionality on website, the contrast ratio
        of at least 4.5:1 against the surrounding colors. This isnt a hard and fast rule though, as there are some exceptions.
        Any graphic that has a minimum height and width of 3px as well as logo types or anything that is non-essential is excluded.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;UI elements are also required to meet contrast standards in 2.1. Any UI elemenet deemed essential
        to understand content functionality must meet a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 against the surrounding colors. Exceptions for This
        include elements with a minimum of 3px must meet a contrast ratio of 3:1. Disbaled or inactive UI elements are also
        exempt from this guideline.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; Caluculating these contrast ratios seems like a really tedious task, but it's not! There are a lot of great resources out
        there but here are the two main ones I use in my workflow:
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
              &lt;a href=&quot;http://contrast-finder.tanaguru.com/&quot;&gt;
                Tanaguru contrast checker
              &lt;/a&gt;
              is one of my favorite web-based tools for this. It not only allows you to choose between contrast ratios, it also
              offers suggestions for similar colors if your combination doesn't meet the ratio you need.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.getstark.co/&quot;&gt;
              Stark sketch plugin
            &lt;/a&gt;
            is a way to check your contrast ratios right within Sketch. One of the cool things about this one is that
            you can also test your color combinations against the many types of color blindess (yes, there are several types).
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;



    &lt;h3&gt;2). Don’t use color alone to communicate&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      While we are on the subject of color blindness, we also need to make sure that color is not an essential communicator
      of content or functionality. This mainly pertains to forms and error states. If an error is communicated to a color
      blind user only by the use of red text, there really is no way for them to know where that error is in the page.
      Many accessible websites will use the &lt;span&gt;&amp;#9888;&lt;/span&gt; warning symbol along with red text to communicate than
      and error has occured.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      One of my favorite games is Dots , a silly phone game that releases serotonin in your brain when you connect
      colored dots together. The game does have a great color blind mode where each dot has a shape inside it that corresponds
      to its color. A medium article written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/intrepid-s-insights/designing-for-and-with-color-blindness-48392aab3d87&quot;&gt;color blind designer, Aaron Tenbuuren&lt;/a&gt;
      goes into detail about how Dots and other apps design for color blind users successfully.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;3.) Design focus states for all ui components and allow for keyboard navigation&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    As a someone who doesn't use accessibility features on devices, I definately have a bias towards navigating
    with a mouse or trackpad over a keyboard or other assistive devices. Many different types of users will use
    non-mouse devices including blind users who use screen readers. People with MS or arthritis will use the keyboard
    because using a mouse is often painful and difficult. Power users of complex forms also use keyboard naviagtion
    simply because its a more efficient than clicking into each and every element. Regardless of a users ability or
    behavior, allowing for keyboard navigation requires considering what all the different states of a form element
    will look like. States include disabled, deafult, active and focus. The focus state is especially helpful because
    it communicates to users what part of the website they are currently on. One of my favorite resources for this
    is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/form-controls/&quot;&gt;U.S. Web Design Standards&lt;/a&gt;,
    which is an open source design system used by all U.S. federal websites.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;4). Use alt text for non-text components&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        For people that use screen readers to read written conenet also need access to non-written content. This includes
        maps, graphics, photos, animations and video. In order to do this alt tags are added in HTML to include a short
        message of what the non-text content is about. Although this is something done mostly during front end development,
        as designers we not only design the UI, but we also design and shape the content. It's important to craft image
        descriptions to give the same context for both sighted and non sighted users.
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/&quot;&gt;Microsoft design&lt;/a&gt; has a series of videos
        about the power of inclusive design that has great voice over descriptions of what is happening in the video. These
        not only give context to the videos, but they add value for all users.
      &lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;h3&gt;5). Use proper headings with HTML semantic markup&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Another practice that makes sure users who with screen readers can easily navigate through a websites content is
      by using proper HTML mark up for headings. Doing this the screen reader reads each header to the user as they
      go through the content on the page from top to bottom. It will tell the user what is a header and what is paragraph
      content. It also allows the user to easily and quickly jump through content, by listing out the headings from h1 to
      h6 so they can be used as a table of contents. Although writing this code is a part of front end development, you need
      to establish the type heirarchy first. An easy way to figure out your type sizes, I reccomend using
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://type-scale.com/&quot;&gt;type scale&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, a web based tools that sets heirarchy based on a different set of
      ratios.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>CSS Positioning</title>
        <description>&lt;header&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;CSS Positioning&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
    The &lt;code&gt;position&lt;/code&gt; property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element. The position
    types are &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;relative&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;fixed&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;absolute&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sticky.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&quot;positions&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Static&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    HTML elements are positioned &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; by default. Static positioned elements are not affected by the &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bottom&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt; properties. An element with position: &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; is
    not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:
    &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;
        .static&lt;br&gt;
        {&lt;br&gt;
        width: 100px;&lt;br&gt;
        height: 100px;&lt;br&gt;
        background-color: #ff6a6a;&lt;br&gt;
        float: left;&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;position: static;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        }&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/code&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;static1&quot;&gt;static&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;middle&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Relative&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    An element with &lt;code&gt;position: relative;&lt;/code&gt; is positioned relative to its normal position. Setting the &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;bottom&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause
    it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;code&gt;
    .relative&lt;br&gt;
      {&lt;br&gt;
      width: 100px;&lt;br&gt;
      height: 100px;&lt;br&gt;
      background-color: #ff6a6a;&lt;br&gt;
      float: left;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;position: relative;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;left: 30px;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      }&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;relative1&quot;&gt;relative&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;middle&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fixed&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    An element with &lt;code&gt;position: fixed;&lt;/code&gt; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the
    same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.
    A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;code&gt;
    .fixed&lt;br&gt;
      {&lt;br&gt;
      width: 100px;&lt;br&gt;
      height: 100px;&lt;br&gt;
      background-color: #ff6a6a;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;position: fixed;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;bottom: 0;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;right: 0;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      }&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/code&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;fixed1&quot;&gt;fixed&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;middle&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sticky&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
  An element with &lt;code&gt;position: sticky;&lt;/code&gt; is positioned based on the user's scroll position. A sticky element toggles
  between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned &lt;code&gt;relative&lt;/code&gt; until a given offset
  position is met in the viewport - then it &quot;sticks&quot; in place (like position:fixed).
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;code&gt;
    .sticky&lt;br&gt;
    {&lt;br&gt;
    width: 200px; &lt;br&gt;
    height: 200px;&lt;br&gt;
    background-color: #FFB9B9;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;position: sticky;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;position: -webkit-sticky;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;top: 0;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    }&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/code&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;sticky&quot;&gt;sticky
    &lt;img src= &quot;/images/sticky.svg.png&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;example of sticky css positioning&quot;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Absolute&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    An element with &lt;code&gt;position: absolute;&lt;/code&gt; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
    (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed). However; if an absolute positioned element has no
    positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;code&gt;
    .absolute1&lt;br&gt;
    {&lt;br&gt;
      width: 100px;&lt;br&gt;
      height: 100px;&lt;br&gt;
      background-color: #ff6a6a;&lt;br&gt;
      float: left;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;position: relative;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    }&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/code&gt;

  &lt;code&gt;
    .absolute2&lt;br&gt;
    {&lt;br&gt;
      width: 100px;&lt;br&gt;
      height: 100px;&lt;br&gt;
      background-color: #ff6a6a;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;position: absolute;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;top: 2300px;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;right: 300;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    }&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/code&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;absolute1&quot;&gt;relative&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;absolute2&quot;&gt;absolute&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Z Index&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    When elements are positioned, they can overlap other elements. The &lt;code&gt;z-index&lt;/code&gt; property specifies the stack order
    of an element (which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others). An element can have a positive or
    negative stack order.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;code&gt;
      .zindex&lt;br&gt;
      {&lt;br&gt;
        width: 100px;&lt;br&gt;
        height: 100px;&lt;br&gt;
        background-color: #ff6a6a;&lt;br&gt;
        float: left;&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;position: absolute;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;pleft: 50px;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;top: 2800px;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;z-index: 1;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      }&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;zindex1&quot;&gt;z-index&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;middle&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Apprenticeship Goals</title>
        <description>&lt;header&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Apprenticeship Goals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;

&lt;section&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
  This week I started my design apprenticeship at 8th Light. As I am at the beginning of my journey here, I have some thoughts about how I want to improve during my apprenticeship.
  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where I’ve been&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
  I’m a native Texan where I come from a traditional graphic design background. I received my undergrad there, and instantly realized I couldn't stand the subjectivity of branding and art direction. My last year there I was fortunate enough to get an introduction to UX by taking some usability and app design courses, which changed everything for me. Shortly after graduating I moved with my (now) wife up to Chicago, where I started working as a Product Designer at Threadless.
  There I got to work in a more generalist environment, doing research, ux, visual design and some front end on a platform called Artist Shops. I loved being able to have that focus on a single product and to have an impact on it through every step of our design process. Since then, I’ve been a contract UX Designer at some larger fortune 500 corporations, first at United Airlines and most recently at Blue Cross Blue Shield. The work that I’ve done in the past 2 years has given me valuable experience in conducting ux research, evidence based design, interaction design, accessibility and visual design.
  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where I want to go&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve noticed a common frustration in my experience as a designer: bad code limits access between humans and quality user experiences. This is common thing most professionals in the software world can understand. That sense of hopelessness you get as a designer when after months of research, white boarding and prototyping gets de-scoped into something unrecognizable. On the other hand,  developers often get handled a mock-up with zero documentation and functionality
    that doesn’t exist within the current framework. I'm sure there are many reasons why this happens, but in the end, it's hard handoffs between design and development that makes users hate bad software.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h4&gt;Front End Development&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
      My primary goal is to focus more on front end development,  as I feel it is my weakest area.  I'm competent in building a pretty basic html/css responsive site. I would like to strengthen my skills and knowledge regarding implementation of my code. I'm still very new to GitHub, and specifically would like to understand best practices about file structure, branches and repositories. I’d also like to get experience workings in component libraries. On the design side, I'm pretty obsessed with pattern libraries, and have even built one myself, but would love to understand the front end side of things as well. I've done extensive work on the design side of accessibility standards but I would like to strengthen my development skills in that area as well.
      &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h4&gt;Design&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
      In terms of UX and visual design, I'm experienced and confident in many subjects, but there are definitely areas to improve. In the past I've planned, conducted and synthesized user research into UX strategy, but I've never had the opportunity to sit down with stakeholders and define an mvp with feature prioritization. One of the things that won me over during my interview was learning about how designers have impact on a product starting with the first meeting with the client. In addition, I would like to strengthen my skills with content management and strategy. In my past job I did have the  opportunity to work with a content strategist. As designers, we tend to box the &quot;user experience&quot; to just the interface on the screen and we often forget about the words that we use.
      &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;How I'm going to get there&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        I think the biggest challenge for me is training my brain to think in a different way. Coming from a design background where everything is done is a visual way. This week I began introducing myself to our blog framework which includes understanding the command line and working with ruby. By forcing myself to change my visual right sided brain to think in a more analytical and linear way, I'm making myself extremely uncomfortable, which I couldn't be happier about. Even though I'm putting myself in unfamiliar territory, the people here at 8th Light have been amazing in helping me to work through my blockers quickly and providing me with resources to grow as a professional.
      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

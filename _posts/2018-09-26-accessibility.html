  <h2>What is Web Accessibility</h2>
</header>

    <p>
      Web accessibility is the practice of building (design and developing) websites and other digital products so that users of
      all abilities can access them. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provides a standard on how to do this and
      provides a success criteria of A, AA, and AAA. A success criteria is essentially a measure for the level of complaiance
      a website or application holds itself to.
    </p>
    <br>
      <h3>Inaccessible websites create barriers for users who are/have:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
        Blind or low vision
        </li>
        <li>
        Deaf or Hearing Impaired
        </li>
        <li>
        Cognitative disabilities
        </uli>
        <li>
        Limited motor skills
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
    <h3>Why Should We Care?</h3>
    <p>
      Often times companies brush of accessibility as unnecessary. Remarks such as "Those arent our users" and "We've always
      done it this way" are common rationals for keeping up with the status quo. In a perfect world we should all genuinely
      care about all users, including those with disabilities. Fortunately, there are several benefits to accessibility
      besides that fuzzy feeling you get when you're a decent human being.
    </p>
    <p>
      To put it simply: accessibilty means good business. For example, if a site uses proper things like image alt attributes,
      title and header tags and html semantic markup, it returns better SEO results. Another factor is that most people
      at some point in their lives experience become disabled, even temporarily. Often times, most people
      will have difficulty viewing screens after lasik eye surgery. Broswer features like high contrast mode allow users to
      view screens with less strain on their eyes. Lastly, designing for accessibility safeguards your client against legal
      ramifications for non-complaince. If your client works in areas of the government, healthcare or airlines they are
      are most likely legally bound to adhere to WCAG. Even if they are outside these industries, they are still vulnerable
      to lawsuits. <a href="https://www.boia.org/blog/2018s-flood-of-accessibility-lawsuits">Among others in 2018</a>, giants like
      Amazon and Nike have come under attack for non-compliance.

    <h3>Start by Starting</h3>
    <p>
      Creating and implementing accessible digital products has 3 contributing parties: design (UX/visual), development and
      business. If you and/or your company is new to web accessibility, it can seem pretty intimidating to start. As a designer,
      your advantage is that you have influence from the very begining on implementing accessibity into your digital product.
      Up next well go through some very easy steps in order to start designing for accessibility and its benefits.
    </p>

    <h3>1). Make sure your colors meet contrast ratios</h3>
      <p> One of the first things a designer can to to ensure for accessibility is to make sure their designs meet the
          correct color contrast ratio. The most recent guidelines just came out, 2.1 and with that comes some additional
          requirements from the previous 2.0.
      </p>
      <h4>2.0: Text and Background Color:</h4>
      <p>
        Previously, the only thing color contrast applied to was text and background color. Level AA requires a contrast
        ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. Level AAA requires a contrast ratio of at least
        7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text.
      </p>
      <h4>2.1: Images and UI Elements:</h4>
      <p>
        In the case that a graphic is essential for understanding content or functionality on website, the contrast ratio
        of at least 4.5:1 against the surrounding colors. This isnt a hard and fast rule though, as there are some exceptions.
        Any graphic that has a minimum height and width of 3px as well as logo types or anything that is non-essential is excluded.
      </p>
      <p>UI elements are also required to meet contrast standards in 2.1. Any UI elemenet deemed essential
        to understand content functionality must meet a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 against the surrounding colors. Exceptions for This
        include elements with a minimum of 3px must meet a contrast ratio of 3:1. Disbaled or inactive UI elements are also
        exempt from this guideline.
      </p>
      <p> Caluculating these contrast ratios seems like a really tedious task, but it's not! There are a lot of great resources out
        there but here are the two main ones I use in my workflow:
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>
              <a href="http://contrast-finder.tanaguru.com/">
                Tanaguru contrast checker
              </a>
              is one of my favorite web-based tools for this. It not only allows you to choose between contrast ratios, it also
              offers suggestions for similar colors if your combination doesn't meet the ratio you need.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="http://www.getstark.co/">
              Stark sketch plugin
            </a>
            is a way to check your contrast ratios right within Sketch. One of the cool things about this one is that
            you can also test your color combinations against the many types of color blindess (yes, there are several types).
          </li>
        </ul>



    <h3>2). Donâ€™t use color alone to communicate</h3>
    <p>
      While we are on the subject of color blindness, we also need to make sure that color is not an essential communicator
      of content or functionality. This mainly pertains to forms and error states. If an error is communicated to a color
      blind user only by the use of red text, there really is no way for them to know where that error is in the page.
      Many accessible websites will use the <span>&#9888;</span> warning symbol along with red text to communicate than
      and error has occured.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my favorite games is Dots , a silly phone game that releases serotonin in your brain when you connect
      colored dots together. The game does have a great color blind mode where each dot has a shape inside it that corresponds
      to its color. A medium article written by <a href="https://medium.com/intrepid-s-insights/designing-for-and-with-color-blindness-48392aab3d87">color blind designer, Aaron Tenbuuren</a>
      goes into detail about how Dots and other apps design for color blind users successfully.
    </p>

    <h3>3.) Design focus states for all ui components and allow for keyboard navigation</h3>
    <p>
    As a someone who doesn't use accessibility features on devices, I definately have a bias towards navigating
    with a mouse or trackpad over a keyboard or other assistive devices. Many different types of users will use
    non-mouse devices including blind users who use screen readers. People with MS or arthritis will use the keyboard
    because using a mouse is often painful and difficult. Power users of complex forms also use keyboard naviagtion
    simply because its a more efficient than clicking into each and every element. Regardless of a users ability or
    behavior, allowing for keyboard navigation requires considering what all the different states of a form element
    will look like. States include disabled, deafult, active and focus. The focus state is especially helpful because
    it communicates to users what part of the website they are currently on. One of my favorite resources for this
    is the <a href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/form-controls/">U.S. Web Design Standards</a>,
    which is an open source design system used by all U.S. federal websites.
    </p>

    <h3>4). Use alt text for non-text components</h3>
      <p>
        For people that use screen readers to read written conenet also need access to non-written content. This includes
        maps, graphics, photos, animations and video. In order to do this alt tags are added in HTML to include a short
        message of what the non-text content is about. Although this is something done mostly during front end development,
        as designers we not only design the UI, but we also design and shape the content. It's important to craft image
        descriptions to give the same context for both sighted and non sighted users.
        <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/">Microsoft design</a> has a series of videos
        about the power of inclusive design that has great voice over descriptions of what is happening in the video. These
        not only give context to the videos, but they add value for all users.
      </p>


    <h3>5). Use proper headings with HTML semantic markup</h3>
    <p>
      Another practice that makes sure users who with screen readers can easily navigate through a websites content is
      by using proper HTML mark up for headings. Doing this the screen reader reads each header to the user as they
      go through the content on the page from top to bottom. It will tell the user what is a header and what is paragraph
      content. It also allows the user to easily and quickly jump through content, by listing out the headings from h1 to
      h6 so they can be used as a table of contents. Although writing this code is a part of front end development, you need
      to establish the type heirarchy first. An easy way to figure out your type sizes, I reccomend using
      <a href="https://type-scale.com/">type scale</a>", a web based tools that sets heirarchy based on a different set of
      ratios.

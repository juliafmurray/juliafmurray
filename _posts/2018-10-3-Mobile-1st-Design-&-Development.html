    Mobile first design & devopment is the process of building sites with a focused on the experience for users on mobile
    devices. This is inclusive on process for strategy, design and devlopment. There are many many reasons for working in
    this way. I could list off a bunch of statistics about mobile web browsing surpassing desktop browsing years ago,
    but mobile 1st design is more about market longevity than anything else. People use devices of all different sizes
    any there is little to no chance that will change any time soon. We no longer live in a fixed width world so
    it doesn't make sense to build digital products with that mindset either.
  </p>
<br>
<h3>Mobile 1st Strategy</h3>
  <p>
    Before I start on how to design mobile 1st, we need to start with a strategy. Besides the obvious reason why for ourselves
    and stakeholders, why do your users need a mobile site? What are they trying to do? What kind of constraints are they
    under? Driving a car, sun glare, low battery, running late? Proabably all of the above. This is why it is so important to do
    research before your design process. You can do this through quantitive methods like running google analytics or conducting
    surveys as well as qualitive methods like conducting contextual inquiry interviews where you observe users using the website
    in context to their everyday lives.
  </p>
  <br>
<h3>Design Process</h3>
  <p>
    Once you have your strategy and user goals defined it's time to start designing. Before you start designing, here are a few
    things to keep in mind:
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Design for content, not retrofitting old desktop features</li>
      <li>Use mobile features to drive the UX strategy for all devices</li>
      <li>Don't forget about the nuances touch interactions on mobile vs. mouse interactions on desktop</li>
      <li>Mobile 1st doesnt mean you have to wait to design other device widths until the end. I focus on mobile but design
          all devices concurrently.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Heres a general step by step process as you start planning and ideating your design. This is absolutely not set in stone,
      but this is what works for me:
    </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Start with sketching out the content in a general layout</li>
        <li>Based on your sketch, define your layout and grid in columns and gutters</li>
        <li>Establish a responsive type scale that is structured semantically. Include h1-h6, paragraph, leading and
            line length. Type Scale is one of my favorite ways of setting this up, and it even translates pixels into
            ems and rems. (More on that below)</li>
        <li>Plan out how all of your components are going to behave, but donâ€™t be married to anything. You will tweak and
            refine during development.</li>
      </ol>
<br>
<h3>Development</h3>
  <br>
  <h4>Enabling Multiple Viewports</h4>
  <p>
    Now that you've got your design locked down it's time to translate it into code. One of the first things you need to
    do is tell the browser to pay attention to the viewport width and change what renders based on that. To clarify a
    viewport is visable area in a browser and usually contains a range of widths. Later in your css you can define that a
    tablet viewport is when the browser width is between 960px and 768px. In order to tell the browser to do this, we
    need to add a meta tag in the head of your html, which won't be code that renders in the browser:
    <br>
    <code>meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial scale=1.0 maximum -scale-1.0, user scalable=0"/</code>
    <br>
    If you don't include this tag the browser will continue to re-adjust the desktop website on any viewport width.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h4>Media Queries</h4>
    <p>
      Media queries are a CSS3 technique that define style changes according to an established set of viewport widths. Using
      the <code>@media</code> rule to define various breakpoints. Below I'll break down some of the concepts with mobile first
      development. Check out <a href="link.html">this</a> post for more information about media queries with code examples.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5>Min-Width vs Max-Width</h5>
     <p>
       There are two ways of establishing breakpoints for your design, with a <code>mid-width</code> rule or a <code>mid-width</code>.
       A lot of times, people taking an existing desktop site will use <code>max-width</code> when creating a media query.
       <code>max-width</code> will specify you want to apply styles up to viewports 768px. When creating a site from scratch
       you you can where the mobile 1st mindset applies to <code>min-width</code>. When used with <code>@media</code>
       this rule will specify that you want to apply style changes to viewports 768px and above. If you think back to elementry
       math, the less than and more than symbols may be helpful.
       <br>
       <code>min-width</code> = greater than >
       <br>
       <code>max-width</code> = less than <
     </p>
     <br>
  <h4>Using Responsive Units</h4>
  <p>
    Once you've defined the breakpoints you want your design to change at you'll need to define those style changes, specifically
    in terms of your grid. Up this point as a designer, we've probably been working within fixed units such as pixels. Now that
    we need our design to be flexible, so do our units. We need to now be working within relative units.
  </p>
  <h4>Typography</h4>
  <p>
    For typography we'll now be writing our css using <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code>. The main difference between the
    two is how the browser determines the base px value that they are attached to. For the <code>rem</code> the base pixel the
    browser draws from can be found in the <code>html</code> style. In the case of <code>em</code> the desired pixel value is
    derived from the parent element that it is nested in. Using <code>em</code> is often discouraged because it will inherit any
    other font styles of whatever element it is in. That way something with 1.25em in its own element will look different than
    something with a 1.25 that is nested within another element.
  </p>
  <h4>Grid</h4>
  <p>
    In fixed width layouts we usually create a table with columns set in pixels. Now that we are moving into a more fluid layout
    we'll be sizing things with percentages, and those percentages are relative to the width of the viewport which is 100%.
    So if you have something that takes up 4 columns side by side we would convert those to perceptances. In this case each column
    would not be 25% as you would think. You still need to consider the relative width of the gutters and margins around each column.
    In this instance, you would want to make each column 21.25% leaving the outside margins and inside gutter to be alotted 5% each.

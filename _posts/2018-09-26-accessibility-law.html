  As software crafters we have a lot to keep in mind when we are designing and building for our clients. First of all we have to make the client happy,and that above all else, our solutions helps stakeholders meet their business goals. We’ve also got to ensure that we’re always adhering to our own 8th Light standard of what building quality software means. As designers, one of our main standards is to ensure that software is usable for everyone. On the surface we’re talking about any non-happy path scenario. What if they’re on mobile? What if they’re not familiar with a certain type of software? What if the cafes wi-fi goes out?
</p>
<p class="c-post__content">
  Beyond the basic level of usability there’s accessibility. The gist of it is all users need to have equal access to content on the web no matter what their abilities are. Just think about how you would do a basic google search if you can’t see the screen. What happens if you can’t use a mouse? What if you need to watch a video, but can’t hear the words?
</p>
<p class="c-post__content">
  It’s a common misconception that the intersection of disabled people and internet usage is pretty low. You may think that designing and developing for that situation seems like a real edge case. You’ve got bigger fish to fry. There’s that whole blockchain thing you’re working on.
</p>
<p class="c-post__content">
  Here are some numbers: There are roughly 7.5 billion people that are alive on this planet. 3.2 billion, or half of them, use the internet. One billion people have a some form of disability, world wide.
</p>
<p class="c-post__content">
  That seems pretty overwhelming, but fortunately we have a set of very wordy, confusing guidelines that seem to have been written by some miswired lawyer robot. This is called WCAG or the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. There are different standards for these guidelines. These are success criteria with multiple levels of A, AA or AAA.
</p>
<p class="c-post__content">
  WCAG defines these guidelines for building accessible web content, but also the people it applies to. This included users who are or have:
</p>
<ul class="c-post__list">
  <li class="c-post__item">
    Blind or low vision
  </li>
  <li class="c-post__item">
    Deaf or Hearing Impaired
  </li>
  <li class="c-post__item">
    Cognitive disabilities
  </li>
  <li class="c-post__item">
    Limited motor skills
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 class="c-post__heading">
  Why should we care?
</h3>
<p class="c-post__content">
  Often times company's brush of accessibility as unnecessary. Remarks such as "Those aren't our users" and "We've always done it this way" are common rationale for keeping up with the status quo. In a perfect world we should all genuinely care about all users, including those with disabilities. Fortunately, there are several benefits to accessibility besides that fuzzy feeling you get when you're a decent human being.
</p>
<p class="c-post__content">
  To put it simply: accessibility means good business. For example, if a site uses proper things like image alt attributes, title and header tags and html semantic markup, it returns better SEO results. Another factor is that most people at some point in their lives experience become disabled, even temporarily. People who have had lasik surgery, or broken a hand will experience barriers to information that they may have never thought of before.
</p>
<p class="c-post__content">
  It’s no small task for an organization to make that leap and change their practices to include accessibility. Human empathy is almost never the influencing factor in this decision. Companies without established accessibility practices are at risk for legal ramifications, including lawsuits, settlements and huge fines. In some industries there are even federal mandates which require WCAG compliance. In 2013 the DOT passed a
    <a class="c-post__link" href="https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/new-dot-rules-make-flying-easier-passengers-disabilities">
      mandate
    </a>
  that all airline websites and kiosks have to adhere to these standards.
</p>
<p class="c-post__content">
  In the early aughts, most defendants involved in accessibility cases were either government entities or worked with the government. Usually this was areas of financial, education or healthcare. Starting in the early ‘10s, we are starting to see more businesses in the consumer space coming under attack for non-compliance. Next, we’ll go through some recent accessibility legal battles and then provide practices that we can adopt at 8th Light to protect our clients and ourselves from legal risk.

<h4 class="c-post__heading">Walmart</h4>
<p class="c-post__content">
  Just this year, a lawsuit with between Walmart and three blind Maryland residents has gone underway, alleging an ADA violation because the self-service checkout is not accessible for blind users.
</p>
<p class="c-post__content">
  One of the plaintiffs was at a Walmart self-service checkout, which as a blind person they could not use because there were no audio prompts at the kiosk. The plaintiff has an employee assist her. Unfortunately, without the plaintiff's consent, the Walmart employee charged the card with an extra $40 cash back.
</p>
<p class="c-post__content">
  The plaintiffs are requesting that Walmart take action to make all it’s kiosks accessible for blind customers, to make a statement that they are violating the ADA as well as court costs and attorney fees.  A spokesperson for Walmart claimed that they believe that their checkout procedures violate any discrimination laws. The only action they have taken is to fire the employee who stole from the plaintiff and plan to fight the lawsuit in court.
</p>
<p class="c-post__content">
  It is unfortunate that Walmart has decided not to face these charges and would rather waste time and money fighting the charges rather than implementing these changes. If they had been paying attention, they would know that several other companies in the retail/grocery space that have faced similar lawsuits and lost. These include Winn Dixie, Safeway and Peapod, which we will get into later in this post.
</p>
<p class="c-post__content">
  So what could Walmart do with their kiosks to make them accessible for blind people? The direct answer would be to implement some sort of audio prompting, but it gets more complicated than that. Is that a software or a hardware problem? Do you just attach a screen reader or just enable a VoiceOver iOS like feature?
</p>
<p class="c-post__content">
  There are several ways you could solve for this, but I’ve seen one that is particularly interesting, an assistive device called Storm Audio-Nav. This device allows users to navigate an interface through audio direction. In many cases this device is used for people who are blind, but it also allows users with reading difficulties like dyslexia to use kiosks. In addition people with motor impairments like muscular dystrophy or rheumatoid arthritis can use kiosks paired with Storm Audio-Nav. The device is can be illuminated at multiple levels of brightness and has tactile keys. Lastly the device can be used with newly implemented designs or existing terminals. You can check out the manufacturer here.

<h4 class="c-post__heading">Winn Dixie</h4>
<p class="c-post__content">
  As mentioned earlier, in the past 5 years there has been a trend of retail and grocery store lawsuits targeting web acccesibility. The trend has been specific to a conflict with screen readers and websites. One of the most recent ones is a grocery chain, Winn Dixie. A local blind customer sued the company claiming that they could not access online coupons with their screen reader.
</p>
<p class="c-post__content">
  The judge ruled in order of the plaintiff, which was historical as far as accessibility cases go. In order for an accessibility case to win with private company's, the judge needs to rule that the company's website is covered by the ADA. This time the judge claimed the he did not even have to make that decision because Winn Dixies website is “heavily integrated with Winn-Dixie’s physical store locations and operates as a gateway to the physical store locations.”
</p>
<p class="c-post__content">
  As a designer I find this fascinating because it creates this intersection I had never thought of, which is the cross section of accessibility and service design. Service design is the practice of creating a holistic customer experience both in physical and digital experiences. You can look at accessibility in this same holistic manner. Businesses must accomodate for customers in physical spaces by doing things like installing wheelchair ramps and handrails. If this is the standard, then business must also ensure that their customers also have access to digital content. Here we see these two intersecting beautifully. A user who does not have full access to digital content does not have full access to a physical, public space, which is a cut and dry violation of ADA.
</p>
<p class="c-post__content">
  If you do some searching about web accessibility cases you would see that the majority of them happen because blind users cannot access information with their screenr readers. Screen readers are software that allow blind and visually impaired people to read digital content through synthesized speech or braille display. A screen reader can read the whole page, a piece of text, spell a word, identify different states of things on a page like if a button is active, on focus or disabled. Most major operating systems have available screen reader software. Some of the most common ones are JAWS for desktop computers and VoiceOver for iOS which can be used with iPads and iPhones.
</p>
<h4 class="c-post__heading">How can I build software that works with screen readers?</h4>
<p class="c-post__content">
  A good first step to understanding screen readers is to start thinking in the mindset of content linearization. When a sighted user goes to a website they don't start with reading the first word on the page. They take a minute and scan through the whole page. Users will always have a goal in mind when going to a website. For example, if you are on a restaurant website you may have the goal of looking for their address and hours. By convention, most users know that information might be in the header, or maybe the footer of the page. They'll look in those parts of the layout first and then navigate to other areas if they can't find it there. Non-sighted users will demonstrate that same behavior, and they shouldn't be limited by the technology they use to do so. These macro aspects of a content are similar to a phone menu that only give you a handful of options that allow the user to deep dive into one to get what they are looking for. The linearized content is translated into an audio interface. This is a great mindset to guide designers and developers as they are building web content. This is also in line with our ITCSS and BEM standard at 8th Light where code has specific components nested within larger, reusable layouts.
</p>
<p class="c-post__content">
  Another practice that ensures users with screen readers can easily navigate through a websites content is by using proper HTML markup for headings, paragraph, lists and forms. Essentially if you can use any html element besides a div, use it. This allows the screen reader to read each element to the user as they go through the content on the page from top to bottom. Users can easily and quickly jump through content. Specific to your headings and paragraph content, establishing a type hierarchy during the design phase will save you time with this. A tool I recommend for establishing a hierarchy with consistent type sizes is
<a class="c-post__link" href="https://type-scale.com/">
  type scale
</a>
, a web based tool that sets hierarchy based on a different set of ratios.
